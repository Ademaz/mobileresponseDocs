# Dynamic Groups #

*Works like a group but will automatically update depending on the criteria.*


A group is a collection of units and a dynamic group is automatically built by the system every time you either create, update the group with criteria, resync the group.   
It is also updated when the tags given for a unit matches the tags for the dynamic group.  
For example if this group is created with the tag **magnager** and a unit on that account has the tag **manager** it will automatically be a member of this group.  
When the tag **manager** is removed from the unit it will be removed from the group.  

Apart from how the group is created and updated, the dynamic group is just like any ordinary group. It may be used with triggers and jobs.

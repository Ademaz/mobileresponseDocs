# Incoming message for group trigger #

*Will start the workflow if matching the incoming message sender or receiver in a group.*

This trigger is available to support a few scenarios where the sender or receiver is placed as units in a group.
This still requires resevations for incoming channels such as an incoming phone number.



**Notes:  
The workflow must be inactive in order to save and update triggers.**


**How to:**  
The recommendation is to use the other triggers, and in cases where till is provided by an installation or a setup from Bosbec Team, advice is to contact support before using or modifying existing setup with this trigger.

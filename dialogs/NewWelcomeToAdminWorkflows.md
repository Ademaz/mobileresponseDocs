### <center>Workflows</center>

Workflows are what we use to create digital solutions. They consist of triggers, jobs and they use resources from your account such as groups, units and messages.

Triggers start the execution and it could for example be an incoming http call, an incoming message or a scheduled time. The trigger is then connected to one or more jobs.

Jobs perform different tasks, there are three main categories. The transform or store data, they evaluate data or they perform an action.

Resources can be used by the jobs if you for example want to send a message to a group.

The workflows are built using the workflow builder which is a webbased GUI that can be found in the workflows section.

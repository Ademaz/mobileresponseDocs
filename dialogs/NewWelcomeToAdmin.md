### <center>Thank you for creating a Bosbec account</center>

The **Bosbec WE** platform can be used for many purposes. A few preconfigured services will be installed on your account. Which services are installed depends on what solution you signed up for. You can also create completely customized solutions using the **Workflow Builder**. 

Your account is valid for one month of free testing with enough credits to send a few messages. Use your test period to find out how you prefer to use the **Bosbec WE** platform!

After your trial period ends, you will probably want to continue using the service. Your new favorite service will continue to be available for 199 euros per month + transfer costs for messages.

To continue using the service after your test period ends, add your credit card information under **Settings and Billing**. 

Should you have any questions during your development journey, please contact us at **support@bosbec.com**.

_When clicking "Got it" you'll be prompted to install included services._

# The group operations #

*This is the job that should be used when operating on a group.*

The job has four parts, Find, Filter, Operate and Store.


The idea is to get groups, optionally filter out and select a few of them, perform an operation on each of the groups after the filter. And finally perform a storage-operations such as saving to account / workflow or deleting the groups.


Operations can be: RemoveMembers, UpdateGroupData



**Notes:  
See information about groups.**


**How to:**  
Configure find-step, optionally add a filter and operation then select what store-step to take.

# Workflows #
Ok, so what we call a Workflow is in fact a template or configuration for how a series of actions (jobs) are set up with input, output, rules and what will initiate the execution of these actions.

Workflows are used for a wide range of purposes. Here is just a few different takes on what have been created with Workflows.

- For empowering MobileResponse customers to take control of important processes such as importing units or to configure the message-sending process.
- Logging results or data-input from different sources. For example, connect a temperature-device via MQTT-protocol and store values in the DataLog. Improve that solution by letting the workflow test the incoming value with the average of values from last week and notify user.
- Configure and send questionnaires (forms) to recipients via email, app and SMS and either take different actions depending on answers or export the results as CSV-file and get results on FTP or as email-attachment.
- As the implementation of “MobileResponse services”.
- As Group-Chat where everyone can interact with their own preferred medium of message.

Part of the staffing package, "first come, first served" provides the ability to ask for volunteers to fill a number of spots. Whoever answers reserves a spot until the required amount of volunteers has been reached or the stop time has been reached.

* Message - Enter the text you wish to send to the group.
* Recipients - Select the group, or groups, you wish to send the message to. 
* Select number of available spots
* Stop time (optional) - If the time you've entered is reached before the available spots have been filled, the request will be closed.
* Confirm execution - Click "Run" to confirm the information given on the left and send the message.

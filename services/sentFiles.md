Files sent will be listed in the table on the left hand side.

Note that files uploaded to the file service needs to be prefiexed with "LS_xxx_" where X are digits.

This code will be matched to a unit on the account which has the corresponding code as metadata (i.e. a file named LS_123_20180806.pdf would be sent to a unit with metadata code = LS_123_)

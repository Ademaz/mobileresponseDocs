Files sent will be listed in the table on the left hand side.

Note that files uploaded to the file service prefixed with a name matching your entered regex will be sent automatically to a unit with the corresponding code.

Example: If you've set up the regex FILE\_\d{3}\_ a file named FILE\_123\_20180806.pdf would be sent to a unit with metadata code = FILE\_123\_

The regex can be found and changed by right clicking the workflow in the workflow list.

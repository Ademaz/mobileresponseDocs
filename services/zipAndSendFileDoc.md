This service provides a way to send zipped files to recipients, by mail.

**Overview**

The service does two things:

1) Whenever a file is uploaded to the Mobile Response file library (through admin, for example), the workflow will create a unit containing information about that file. These "file-reference" units can then be found in the dynamic group "Uploaded files" on the account.

2) When the service is run, you will be prompted to select a file, a group to send to and some optinal settings (see below). This will result in mails with attached zip files.

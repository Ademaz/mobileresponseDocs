Just like the name implies, Encrypted Messages allows you to send encrypted messages from the service to recipients with the Bosbec App.

**Sending a message**

1. Click on "Send".
2. Enter the message text in the text area.
3. Enter the key's alias in the first input field.
4. Enter the actual key in the second input field.
5. Click on "Next".
6. Select the group you want to send the encrypted message to.
7. Click on "Next".
8. Confirm the selected settings and click "Run".

Note that the recipients need to have the entered key available on their app in order to read the message.

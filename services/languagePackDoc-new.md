<div style="max-width: 50%">Language packs are not executable services, but collections of message templates and forms.

Some services (like Staffing, Messaging and Incident) have a language setting. In order to use this setting properly, you also need to have the associated language pack installed.

The templates are installed in the form of a "workflow" that serves as a container.

All message templates, forms and form-paths (= questions) in the pack have a so-called "installeridentifier" metadata value, meaning that once they have been added to your account, they will not be changed by any service update of the language pack. They will stay exactly the way they are, id:s and all.

Therefore: if you see an update notification for a pack and want to make sure that you get any changes to the templates, you need to uninstall the language pack and then install it again.

Any NEW templates added in an update will still be added to your account when updating. It's just the ones you already have that will stay unchanged. 

This behavior means you are free to edit these templates if you want to, in order to personalize your services with other texts. Just keep in mind that if you uninstall the pack, they will disappear.

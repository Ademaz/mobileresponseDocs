Incident Service
============
## Injury Incident ##

A predefined process to facilitate action during an injury event.

**Overview**

* There are several steps that can be performed in this incident service:
  * Start incident
  * Request check-in (= call to a meeting, in most cases)
  * Appoint a moderator (= a person tasked with folloing up the injury incident ticket through a form. Ticket alias is set in this form)
  * Update incident (= send a message to a group, and set/update status and priority)
  * Start group chat
  * Close group chat
  * Close incident
  * Order report
* A log of all updates will be kept and can later be exported.
* Incidents can be either "Open" or "Closed". The two different states are shown separately on the left side of this view.

**Start**

* The process can be started through this user interface.
* Alternatively, it can be started by messaging "injury" to a predefined app user, which will send a form back to you with the start questions.

**Statuses**

Each incident has one of the below status properties;
  * Investigating
  * Identified
  * Monitoring
  * Resolved
  * Handed over

**Priority**

Each incident is assigned a priority (through "Update") which ranges in severity from Lowest (1) to Highest (5).

This service is used to invite new allowed senders to the support service and to close open tickets.

**Invite**

Inviting a new user adds them to the allowed senders group and sends a message from the system app user. Tickets are started by replying to that app user.

**Close Ticket**

Closing a ticket removes it from the list, sends a message in the support chat, and locks the chat.

The loyalty program services are used to provide increased value to your customers by rewarding them for their purchases. Each invoice generates points which in turn can redemeed for rewards.

The loyalty program service handles the customer details requests and adding or redeeming points for a customer while a loyalty program integration service receives and automatically processes the invoice data and generates the loyalty points based on the invoiced amount.

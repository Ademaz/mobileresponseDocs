Incident Service
============
## Checkin Incident ##

A predefined process to facilitate action during an event that requires check-in where people are split up into groups, each with a responsible "moderator".

**Overview**

* Incidents can be either "Open" or "Closed". The two different states are shown separately on the left side of this view.

**Components**

Report ticket
* Initialize an injury incident by answering some start questions. Note that starting an injury ticket through the icon here in admin is non-standard, and is mostly available for testing purposes.
* The expected way to initialize an injury incident is through app-in, by sending "injury" to the predefined base app user, which will give you back a form with the start questions.
* Submitting the form will start a new incident ticket and will notify management, who are then expected to appoint a moderator to follow up the incident. This notification contains the answers from the start form.
* You - the requester - will also get a confirmation message back, to let you know that the ticket was successfully started.
* You can select to use a reminder for this when using admin, by entering an interval in minutes. It will be sent to management, if a moderator has yet to be appointed. When using app-in, a reminder is automatically activated and set to 20 minutes. 

Request check-in
* Select receiving moderators (which also selects their groups). Write the message that will be sent to each moderator, and then the message that will be sent to each individual in their groups.
* When run, this action initializes a new incident ticket and sends a confirmation about this to everyone in management. Immediately after that, all moderators receive a message with the text you submitted plus a checkbox form listing all the people in their group.

Close incident
* Close the incident ticket. Management will get notified about this through a message.

Order report
* Only available for closed tickets.
* Compiles a report for the selected ticket and sends that to everyone in management, by mail (so e-mail address needs to be set on the unit, for this). The requester will also get an app-message saying that the report has been delivered.

**About access**

* In order to perform any of the steps for this incident type, you generally need to be represented by a unit in the "Checkin incident management" group.
* Connection to a unit is currently done through phone number, so units need to have that set.
* When using the service steps here in admin, the default behaviour is that the phone number of the logged in administrator is used for identification. You can override this by entering another phone number manually when performing a service step. But it needs to be the phone number of a unit that is allowed to perform the service step.
* When using app-in, you need to have registered the phone number for the app user (and have a unit with that phone number in one of the allowed groups).

# Data Log Setup #

*Creates or updates the setup/configuration for a data-log.*

This job can configure the metadata for a given log(-key). Metadata for the log can be used to make sense of the data or for example, indicate what type of content is in the datalog.

The only thing this job can do is the setup of the DataLog. It cannot store values for the datalog, for that either use DataOperations or StoreData-job.

**Notes:
Related to DataOperation (LogData) and the StoreData-job**

**How to:**
Set the log key, and enter metadata in the table.
Use the “Tab” key to tell the workflow-builder that you need another row.
